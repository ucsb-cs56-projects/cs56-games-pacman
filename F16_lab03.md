a. This is a remake of the game Pac-Man in which the player moves Pac-Man around to eeat pellets and avoid being eaten by the ghosts.

b. As a single player, I can control Pac-Man and navigate the maze to eat pellets and avoid the ghosts. As two players, I can play either Co-op or versus mode in which the two users control Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man or player 2 controls one ghost.

c. In its current state, the program runs pretty well. When opened, the program displays a menu with the game modes. Once a game mode is selected, the player uses the keys to control Pac-Man and move around the maze. Once they die three times, the game displays the high score menu with the user's high scores and the all time high scores.

d. As a player, I can eat a power pellet so that I can eat ghosts. As a player, I can view the different high scores for different game modes. As a player in the versus mode controlling a ghost, I can speed up as more pellets are eaten. As a player in versus mode controlling a ghost, I can eat the power pellet in order to speed up. As a player in versus controlling Pac-Man, I can eat the last pellet so that I can win the game. As a player, I can reset the high score list back to empty. As a user, I can make the ghosts have different colors and personalities (i.e. chasing styles). As a player, I can only be chased by 4 ghosts in single player mode.

e. The quality of the README.md file is good. We can add pictures of the different game modes so that future generations will understand what they look like.

f. The build.xml file is good in its current state. All targets have descriptions.

g. Yes, theres seems to be enough "issues" to get 1000 points. Yes the issues clearly explain the problem, and the expectations for the solution.

i. The code is well organized and easy to read. The code is organized into subclasses integrating common parts of multiple classes such as Character.java. Board.java and PacMan.java contain most of the gameplay and display code, whereas Character.java, and PacPlayer.java contain code for the game's players. The other classes are used to help maintain the leaderboard. One issue is the name of the PacMan.java class. You would think that it is the name of the class containing code for the Pac-Man character but it is actually code for displaying the JFrame of the game, which is a little confusing. If we had to show a new programmer "one screenful of text", we would show them the playGame() method in Board.java because it shows a simple run-down of how the game works.

j. The test coverage is not that great. There are tests for Leaderboard.java and GamePlayed.java but those are only for the highscore board. It would be hard to test ghost or player movement without actually playing the game which is why there are no tests for those.
